- **Sentiment Analysis** - Financial sentiment classification using FinBERT
- **Fact Checking** - Verification of financial claims and news
- **Fraud Detection** - Machine learning models for transaction fraud detection
- **Portfolio Allocation** - Optimize investment portfolios using RL algorithms

## Installation

1. Install FinRl:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL.git
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Download stock data for specified tickers
data = download_stock_data(tickers=['SPY', 'AAPL', 'MSFT'], period='1y')
```

### Sentiment Analysis

```python
from agents.sentiment_agent import classify_sentiment

headline = "Tesla stock drops after CEO sells $5 billion in shares"
result = classify_sentiment(headline)
print(f"Sentiment: {result['sentiment']}, Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
```

### Fact Checking

```python
from agents.fact_checker_agent import fetch_fact_checks

claim = "Company XYZ reported record profits last quarter"
fact_checks = fetch_fact_checks(claim)
```

## Reinforcement Learning

The project integrates FinRL, a deep reinforcement learning library for automated stock trading. See the Jupyter notebook in `/agents/FinRL_PortfolioAllocation_NeurIPS_2020.ipynb` for examples.
